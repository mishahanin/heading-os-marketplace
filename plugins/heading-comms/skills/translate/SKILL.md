description: Translate text between Russian and English (or other languages on request), preserving register, tone, and meaning rather than producing a literal word-for-word rendering. Use when the user wants a passage translated. Trigger when the user says "translate", "translate this to Russian/English", or pastes Russian text that needs an English rendering (or vice versa). Do NOT use for drafting new content (use the relevant content/comms skill).

## Instructions

Read `reference/misha-voice.md` before translating (especially the Russian Language Notes section).

Translate the provided text with these guidelines:

**English to Russian:**
- Use natural Russian — not stiff literal translation
- Match the register: personal messages get warmer Russian, business messages get direct professional Russian
- Preserve maritime metaphors where they work in Russian; adapt where they don't
- Do NOT translate ODUN.ONE, 31C, DPI+, or proper nouns
- Personal/emotional messages: allow the warmth to come through more fully than in English (Russian allows it)

**Russian to English:**
- Translate to Misha's English voice — direct, warm, authentic
- Do not over-formalize; Russian formality often over-translates into stiff English
- Flag any cultural nuances the translation should preserve or adapt

After translation:
- Provide the translation
- Note any phrases that required cultural adaptation (not word-for-word translation)
- If business context: suggest any additional 31C terminology to add or adjust
