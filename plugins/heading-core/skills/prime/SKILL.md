## Read

First, read `.workspace-identity.json` to determine workspace type.

CLAUDE.md is already auto-loaded by the Claude Code harness (visible in the system prompt's `claudeMd` block) - do NOT re-read it.

Load the following files in this order (paths depend on workspace type):

**CEO workspace** (flat paths):
1. `context/personal-info.md` - who Misha is
2. `context/business-info.md` - 31C organization and ODUN.ONE
3. `context/strategy.md` - strategic priorities and arc
4. `context/current-data.md` - current metrics, milestones, active workstreams
5. `context/people.md` - **read only the "Top 10 Active Contacts (summary)" section.** Full file remains available - Read `context/people.md` when a specific named contact requires deeper context.
6. `context/pipeline.md` - active deals and investor conversations
7. `reference/workspace-overview.md` - **read only the H1 + "## Index" section.** Defer the per-section detail to lazy-read when a specific tool, script, or system needs deeper context.
8. `datastore/INDEX.md` - **read only the H1 + "## Top-Level Structure (summary)" section.** Defer the per-document tables to lazy-read when a specific fact needs validating.

**Exec workspace** (shared content under `corporate/`, personal under `personal/`):
1. `personal/context/personal-info.md` - who the exec is
2. `corporate/context/business-info.md` - 31C organization and ODUN.ONE
3. `corporate/context/strategy.md` - strategic priorities and arc
4. `corporate/context/current-data.md` - current metrics, milestones, active workstreams
5. `corporate/context/people.md` - **read only the "Top 10 Active Contacts (summary)" section** when present. Full file remains available for lazy-read.
6. `corporate/context/pipeline.md` - active deals and investor conversations
7. `corporate/datastore/INDEX.md` - **read only the H1 + "## Top-Level Structure (summary)" section** when present.

## Summary

After reading, provide a structured session brief:

## Setup-wizard status check (first line of brief when incomplete)

If `.workspace-identity.json` does NOT have `type: "ceo-master"`, run:

`python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/apply-wizard-answers.py --status`

Parse the returned `completion_pct`. If it is `< 100`, prepend this line to the brief above every other section:

> Setup is `<completion_pct>`% complete - `<required.pending + required.skipped>` required questions open. Run /setup-wizard to finish.

Skip entirely when:
- `.workspace-identity.json` has `type: "ceo-master"`, OR
- `--status` exits non-zero, OR
- `completion_pct >= 100`.

### 1. Context Confirmation
Brief statement: who the user is, what 31C is, where we are (post-launch, deployments in progress), current operational state. Include workspace type (CEO or exec) as detected from `.workspace-identity.json`.

### 2. Pipeline Pulse
Summary of active deals, investor conversations, and partnership discussions from pipeline.md. Flag anything requiring immediate attention.

### 2.1 Previous Session Handoff
Check if `outputs/operations/handoff.md` exists. If it does:
- Read the file and extract the YAML frontmatter (`created`, `session_summary`, `task_progress`, `urgency`) and the `## Next Action` section body
- Present to the user:

> ## Previous Session Handoff
> Created: {created}
> Summary: {session_summary}
> Progress: {task_progress} tasks
> Next action: {next_action text from body}
>
> Resume this work, or start fresh?

- If user says **resume**: load the referenced plan file (from `plan` frontmatter field, if present) and pick up from the next action described in the handoff
- If user says **fresh** or moves on to a different topic: move the handoff file to `outputs/operations/handoff-archive/YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm-{slug}.md` where slug is derived from `session_summary` (lowercase, spaces to hyphens, truncated to 40 chars). Create the `handoff-archive/` directory if it doesn't exist.
- If the `urgency` field is `high`, flag the handoff prominently: "**URGENT handoff from previous session - review before starting new work.**"

If `outputs/operations/handoff.md` does not exist, skip this section entirely (do not mention handoffs).

### 2.5-2.13 Parallel Health Block

Run the seven health checks in parallel via one helper:

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/prime-health-parallel.py
```

**Run it from the workspace you launched in — do not navigate away.** In the HEADING OS
split layout, scripts live in the ENGINE clone (`.heading-os`, your launch directory) and
all data is auto-resolved under the DATA root (`.heading-os-data`) by the scripts
themselves. So run the helper straight from the current directory. Do NOT `cd` into the
data overlay (`.heading-os-data` has no `scripts/`), and NEVER fall back to a different
workspace such as `ceo-main` — that would report a DIFFERENT workspace's data and silently
mislead the briefing. If the helper errors, debug it in place; the correct invocation is
always the bare `python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/prime-health-parallel.py` from the launch directory.

This single invocation dispatches CRM health, Knowledge health, Memory file scan, Email-Intel state check, Threads archive-scan, Fireside daemon health, and Sync-Exchange daemon health to a `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=7)` and prints aggregated output in the order /prime expects:

- **### 2.5 Relationship Radar** -- RED contacts (overdue), YELLOW contacts (approaching), Active commitments due in the next 7 days, Total contacts tracked / individual CRM files. CEO workspace also surfaces company-wide CRM from crm-central.
- **### 2.7 Knowledge Base Health** -- total notes and status breakdown (seeds / growing / evergreen), stale seeds (>7 days old still seed status), orphan notes count, top 5 keywords.
- **### 2.9 Memory Health** -- count of memory files, MEMORY.md N/200 line budget, files >45 days flagged for review, orphan files (in memory directory but not linked from MEMORY.md). All clean = "Memory: N files, M/200 lines. All healthy."
- **### 2.10 Email Intelligence Status** -- last_run age vs 20-hour threshold, pending P1 task count from tasks.md. "Never run" surfaced when state.json missing.
- **### 2.11 Active Threads archive scan** -- dry-run results from `thread.py archive-scan`. Failure of this check never blocks /prime; the helper degrades the panel gracefully.
- **### 2.12 Fireside Daemon** -- daemon liveness check via `.fireside/daemon.pid`. If daemon is dead, pulse spawns a detached `fireside-bot-daemon.py daemon` automatically using the isolated venv. If alive, reports `started M/N`, `last poll X min ago`, and the next scheduled job time. Failure of auto-spawn surfaces an inline error with the manual fallback command.
- **### 2.13 Sync-Exchange Daemon** -- daemon liveness check via `.sync-exchange/daemon.pid`. If daemon is dead, pulse spawns a detached `sync-exchange-daemon.py daemon` cross-platform: `pythonw.exe` + `cmd /c start /B` on Windows, `start_new_session=True` on POSIX. If alive, reports pid + relative time of the last successful sync (parsed from `.sync-exchange/daemon.log`). The daemon runs `python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/sync-exchange.py --calendar --emails` every 2 hours; the first run fires immediately on daemon start. **Note:** on the always-on service host (Linux service VM, 2026-05-23+), this daemon runs as a systemd user unit, so the local PID file may be absent on the CEO machine even when Exchange sync is healthy — check the service host's heartbeat in that case.

After the parallel block prints, render the **Active Threads panel** (this part is not part of the parallel script - it requires reading MEMORY.md and per-thread files):

1. Read `## Active Threads` from MEMORY.md.
   - If the `## Active Threads` section is absent from MEMORY.md (no threads have been opened yet), skip the panel silently and continue.
2. For each thread line, parse the link target and read the file's `## Open follow-ups` section.
3. Count unchecked `- [ ]` items.
4. Render as:

```text
## Active Threads (N)

Business (M):
  - <title> - <hook> [K follow-ups open]
  ...

Personal (P) [CEO-ONLY]:
  - <title> - <hook> [K follow-ups open]
  ...
```

The archive-scan results from the parallel block above feed this section: if candidates exist, surface them with "Archive candidates: <list>. Run `python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/thread.py archive-scan --apply` to archive." If no candidates and no error, render no panel (silent success).

A failing health check in the parallel block never blocks the others; one failure is reported inline and /prime continues.

### 3. Upcoming Events & Deadlines
From current-data.md: any events, meetings, or deadlines in the next 30 days.

### 4. Strategic Heading
Current strategic heading and any drift signals visible from context.

### 5. Data Freshness
Check context file headers for `> Last verified: YYYY-MM-DD` dates. Flag any context file older than 30 days as stale. Note if DataStore has key documents loaded or is still sparse.

Also check sync output files - any file in `outputs/_sync/calendar/`, `outputs/_sync/emails/`, or `outputs/operations/email-intelligence/state.json` whose mtime is older than 48 hours is flagged RED with the literal label "SYNC STALE". The line format is:

> SYNC STALE: outputs/_sync/calendar/upcoming.md last refreshed Ndays ago — run `python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/sync-exchange.py` (or expected automation has stopped).

This catches a silent sync failure within one /prime cycle rather than 2 weeks later. The 48-hour threshold is intentional - allows a weekend gap, surfaces anything longer. If all sync files are fresh, the section reports "Sync data: fresh (all <48h)."

### 6. Available Skills

The canonical skill registry lives in `.claude/rules/skill-router.md` (already loaded as an always-active rule, so no re-read needed). Surface a CEO-facing catalog by:

1. Pulling skill names + one-line triggers from the skill-router skill registry tables (Intel / Communication / Content / CRM / Design / Strategy / Operations).
2. Suggest the 2-3 most contextually relevant skills for today, drawing on the pipeline pulse and active threads loaded earlier.
3. For a state-aware next-step recommendation mid-session, point the CEO at `/next` (reads what just happened and names the logical next command).

This section deliberately defers to the router rather than duplicating the catalog inline - the router is the single source of truth and the only file that updates when a new skill is added. Drift between this catalog and the actual `.claude/skills/` directory is exactly the failure mode the workspace-deep-audit (2026-05-14) flagged; the registry tables are now generated from each skill's `x-heading-routing` frontmatter, and `scripts/generate-skill-router.py --check` enforces (in CI and pre-commit) that the router matches its source with no content drift.

### 7. Ready

Confirm ready to execute. Ask: "What are we working on today?"
