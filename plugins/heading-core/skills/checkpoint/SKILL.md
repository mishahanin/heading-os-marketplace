# /checkpoint

Save a manual session checkpoint without running `/compact` or clearing context.

## What this does

- Writes ONE combined handoff file to `outputs/operations/handoff-archive/`
- Updates FOUR pointer files: this session's pair under
  `.latest/{session-slug}/{summary.md,prompt.md}`, which the SessionStart inject
  hook reads, and the shared pair at `.latest/{summary.md,prompt.md}`, which
  `/next` reads as "the newest handoff in this workspace"
- Does NOT run `/compact`
- Does NOT clear the session
- Does NOT continue implementation after writing - wait for the user to direct next action

Every path is keyed by session id. Several sessions run on this workspace at
once, and a shared pointer is last-writer-wins: before 2026-08-16 a resumed
session could be injected another session's handoff.

## When to use

- Soft / hard checkpoint offer fired (`Stop` hook surfaced the context threshold)
- About to switch to an unrelated task, want resume-ready snapshot
- Mid-implementation, want to save state before risky action
- Long session approaching natural pause point

## Procedure

### Step 1 - Get this session's paths

One command prints all of them:

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/checkpoint-paths.py
```

It emits `key=value` lines: `stamp`, `archive`, `summary_pointer`,
`prompt_pointer`, `shared_summary_pointer`, `shared_prompt_pointer`,
`session_id`. Archive paths are data-root-relative, which is the form the
`@`-reference resolves. Use them verbatim - never rebuild a path by hand, and
never write into another session's pointer directory.

If the script is unavailable, fall back to `date -u +'%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S'` for the
stamp and `echo "$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID"` for the session id, then take the
slug as the first 32 characters of that id.

### Step 2 - Write the combined handoff file

The file MUST contain these sections in order. Keep prose concise - this is for resume, not a report:

```markdown
# Handoff - manual checkpoint

Generated: {ISO UTC timestamp}
Trigger: manual-checkpoint
Session: {session id if known}

## Objective

What is the current task aiming to accomplish? One paragraph.

## Acceptance criteria

How will we know the task is done? Bullet list.

## Constraints

What boundaries, deadlines, dependencies, or invariants must hold? Bullet list.

## Decisions

Key choices made so far in this session, with one-line reasoning. Bullet list.

## Files touched / inspected

Absolute or workspace-relative paths grouped by role (read / written / planned). Bullet list.

## Current state

Where are we right now? What is the last action completed? One paragraph.

## Commands / tests

Commands that should be re-run on resume (tests, validators, manual checks). Bullet list.

## Open issues

Known problems, blockers, or questions awaiting answers. Bullet list.

## Next steps

The exact next 1-3 actions to take when resuming. Ordered list.

## Continuation prompt

Continue this Claude Code session from the saved handoff.

First read:

@outputs/operations/handoff-archive/{stamp}_handoff_manual_{session-slug}.md

Then continue the latest unfinished task.

Rules:
1. Treat repository state as authoritative.
2. Do not redo broad discovery unless the summary is insufficient.
3. Before making changes, briefly restate the current objective, constraints, files involved, and next concrete action.
4. Continue implementation from the current repo state.

## User note

$ARGUMENTS
```

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, omit the "User note" section.

### Step 3 - Update the pointer files

Write the same two texts to two places each: the `summary_pointer` /
`prompt_pointer` paths from Step 1 (this session's, the ones that get injected)
and the `shared_summary_pointer` / `shared_prompt_pointer` paths (the workspace's
newest, which `/next` reads). Four files.

The pointer files almost always already exist from a prior checkpoint, and the `Write` tool refuses to overwrite a file that has not been `Read` first in the current session - skipping the read produces `Error writing file`. So for each pointer file below: first `Read` it (ignore a not-found result on a first-ever checkpoint), then `Write` it.

Keep the summary short. It is what gets injected on resume, and the inject hook
truncates at 8000 characters, so anything past that is written and never read.

`Read` then `Write` the summary text to `summary_pointer` AND `shared_summary_pointer`:

```markdown
# Latest handoff summary

Source: outputs/operations/handoff-archive/{archive filename}
Generated: {ISO UTC timestamp}
Trigger: manual-checkpoint

{Copy the "Objective" + "Current state" + "Next steps" sections from the archive file. Keep it short - this is what gets injected on resume.}
```

`Read` then `Write` the continuation prompt to `prompt_pointer` AND `shared_prompt_pointer`:

```
Continue this Claude Code session from the saved handoff.

First read:

@outputs/operations/handoff-archive/{archive filename}

Then continue the latest unfinished task.

Rules:
1. Treat repository state as authoritative.
2. Do not redo broad discovery unless the summary is insufficient.
3. Before making changes, briefly restate the current objective, constraints, files involved, and next concrete action.
4. Continue implementation from the current repo state.
```

### Step 4 - Respond to the user

After writing all five files, reply with:

1. Full path of the archive file written
2. Confirmation that this session's pointer pair and the shared pair were updated
3. One-line current state summary
4. Recommendation: "Run `/compact` manually if you want to free context now. Otherwise nothing else happens - checkpoint is preserved for resume."

Do NOT continue implementation, do NOT call `/compact`, do NOT clear the session. Wait for the user's next instruction.

## Auto mode

`CLAUDE_HANDOFF_AUTO=1` makes the Stop hook drive this skill's procedure with no
prompt when the context threshold is crossed, and the SessionStart hook resume
the task by itself afterwards. It is OFF by default and the operator turns it on
in `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
"env": {
  "CLAUDE_HANDOFF_AUTO": "1",
  "CLAUDE_HANDOFF_SOFT_THRESHOLD": "40",
  "CLAUDE_HANDOFF_HARD_THRESHOLD": "45",
  "CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE": "50"
}
```

The compaction percentage must stay ABOVE the soft threshold, so the checkpoint
always lands before compaction frees the context. Nothing here triggers
compaction; only the native auto-compact does.

## NEVER

- Never invoke `/compact` automatically as part of this skill
- Never clear context as part of this skill
- Never proceed with the next task unless the user explicitly says so after seeing the checkpoint report
- Never skip the pointer file updates - without them, the inject hook has nothing to surface
- Never write into another session's pointer directory
- Never write anything into a pointer directory OTHER than `summary.md` and `prompt.md`
