# /checkpoint

Save a manual session checkpoint without running `/compact` or clearing context.

## What this does

- Writes ONE combined handoff file to `outputs/operations/handoff-archive/`
- Updates FOUR pointer files: this session's pair under
  `.latest/{session-slug}/{summary.md,prompt.md}`, which the SessionStart inject
  hook reads, and the shared pair at `.latest/{summary.md,prompt.md}`, which
  `/next` reads as "the newest handoff in this workspace"
- Does NOT run `/compact`
- Does NOT clear the session
- Does NOT continue implementation after writing - wait for the user to direct next action

The system keys every path by session id. Several sessions run on this workspace
at once, and a shared pointer is last-writer-wins. Before 2026-08-16 the inject
hook could hand a resumed session another session's handoff.

## When to use

- Soft / hard checkpoint offer fired (`Stop` hook surfaced the context threshold)
- About to switch to an unrelated task, want resume-ready snapshot
- Mid-implementation, want to save state before risky action
- Long session approaching natural pause point

## Procedure

### Step 0 - Handle a switch argument first

If `$ARGUMENTS` starts with `auto` or with `unattended`, this is a switch. It is
not a checkpoint.

Run one of these, then stop. Do not write any file.

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/checkpoint-paths.py --auto on
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/checkpoint-paths.py --auto off
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/checkpoint-paths.py --auto status
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/checkpoint-paths.py --unattended on
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/checkpoint-paths.py --unattended off
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/checkpoint-paths.py --unattended status
```

Report the command output in one line. For `auto on`, continue to Step 1 and
write the checkpoint as well. The operator asked at a threshold and expects this
one on disk. For `unattended on`, stop after the report. The operator is about to
leave, so a question here defeats the switch.

Both switches apply to this session only. Each one overrides its own environment
default in both directions. Neither needs cleanup. The state file carries a
session key, and the pruner removes it with the session.

### Step 1 - Get this session's paths

One command prints all of them:

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/checkpoint-paths.py
```

It emits `key=value` lines: `session_id`, `session_slug`, `stamp`,
`project_root`, `data_root`, `archive`, `summary_pointer`, `prompt_pointer`,
`shared_summary_pointer`, `shared_prompt_pointer`, `state`. Archive paths are data-root-relative, which is the form the
`@`-reference resolves. Use them verbatim - never rebuild a path by hand, and
never write into another session's pointer directory.

If the script is unavailable, get the stamp from `date -u +'%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S'`.
Get the session id from `echo "$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID"`. Take the slug as the
first 32 characters of that id.

### Step 2 - Write the combined handoff file

The file MUST contain these sections in order. Keep prose concise - this is for resume, not a report:

```markdown
# Handoff - manual checkpoint

Generated: {ISO UTC timestamp}
Trigger: manual-checkpoint
Session: {session id if known}

## Objective

What is the current task aiming to accomplish? One paragraph.

## Acceptance criteria

How will we know the task is done? Bullet list.

## Constraints

What boundaries, deadlines, dependencies, or invariants must hold? Bullet list.

## Decisions

Key choices made so far in this session, with one-line reasoning. Bullet list.

## Files touched / inspected

Absolute or workspace-relative paths grouped by role (read / written / planned). Bullet list.

## Current state

Where are we right now? What is the last action completed? One paragraph.

## Commands / tests

Commands that should be re-run on resume (tests, validators, manual checks). Bullet list.

## Open issues

Known problems, blockers, or questions awaiting answers. Bullet list.

## Next steps

The exact next 1-3 actions to take when resuming. Ordered list.

## Continuation prompt

Continue this Claude Code session from the saved handoff.

First read:

@outputs/operations/handoff-archive/{stamp}_handoff_manual_{session-slug}.md

Then continue the latest unfinished task.

Rules:
1. Treat repository state as authoritative.
2. Do not redo broad discovery unless the summary is insufficient.
3. Before making changes, briefly restate the current objective, constraints, files involved, and next concrete action.
4. Continue implementation from the current repo state.

## User note

$ARGUMENTS
```

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, omit the "User note" section.

### Step 3 - Update the pointer files

Write the same two texts to two places each. Four files in total.

- `summary_pointer` and `prompt_pointer` from Step 1 hold this session's pair.
  The inject hook reads only these two.
- `shared_summary_pointer` and `shared_prompt_pointer` hold the workspace's
  newest handoff. `/next` reads these two.

A prior checkpoint almost always left these four files in place. The `Write`
tool refuses to overwrite a file that you did not `Read` first in this session,
and it answers with `Error writing file`.

So for each pointer file below, `Read` it and then `Write` it. On a first-ever
checkpoint, ignore the not-found result of the `Read`.

Keep the summary short. The inject hook truncates at 8000 characters, so it
writes anything past that and no session ever reads it.

`Read` then `Write` the summary text to `summary_pointer` AND `shared_summary_pointer`:

```markdown
# Latest handoff summary

Source: outputs/operations/handoff-archive/{archive filename}
Generated: {ISO UTC timestamp}
Trigger: manual-checkpoint

{Copy the "Objective" + "Current state" + "Next steps" sections from the archive file. Keep it short - this is what gets injected on resume.}
```

`Read` then `Write` the continuation prompt to `prompt_pointer` AND `shared_prompt_pointer`:

```
Continue this Claude Code session from the saved handoff.

First read:

@outputs/operations/handoff-archive/{archive filename}

Then continue the latest unfinished task.

Rules:
1. Treat repository state as authoritative.
2. Do not redo broad discovery unless the summary is insufficient.
3. Before making changes, briefly restate the current objective, constraints, files involved, and next concrete action.
4. Continue implementation from the current repo state.
```

### Step 4 - Respond to the user

After writing all five files, reply with:

1. Full path of the archive file written
2. Confirmation that you updated this session's pointer pair and the shared pair
3. One-line current state summary
4. Recommendation: "Run `/compact` manually if you want to free context now. Otherwise nothing else happens - the checkpoint stays on disk for resume."

Do NOT continue implementation, do NOT call `/compact`, do NOT clear the session. Wait for the user's next instruction.

## Auto mode

Auto mode makes the Stop hook run this skill's procedure with no prompt. It
fires once per 5% band, not at every pause, because the same hysteresis that
governs the question governs the silent save. After a compaction, the
SessionStart hook then tells the session to continue the unfinished task; that
instruction is printed only when auto is on. Auto mode is OFF by default.

Nothing here triggers compaction. A hook cannot start a compaction, so Claude
Code's own auto-compact still decides when to free the context. Auto mode only
guarantees that the checkpoint lands first.

**For one session,** flip the switch while you work:

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/checkpoint-paths.py --auto on
```

The threshold offer no longer gives this switch a numbered option. It names the
switch only for the operator who stays at the keyboard, because `unattended`
below is the better answer for the operator who leaves. Auto mode keeps one
property that `unattended` gives up: it hands the turn back immediately, with no
wait. The choice belongs to the current window and dies with it.

**For the whole workspace,** set the environment default in
`.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
"env": {
  "CLAUDE_HANDOFF_AUTO": "1",
  "CLAUDE_HANDOFF_SOFT_THRESHOLD": "40",
  "CLAUDE_HANDOFF_HARD_THRESHOLD": "45",
  "CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE": "50"
}
```

Keep the compaction percentage ABOVE the soft threshold. The checkpoint then
always lands before compaction frees the context.

## Unattended mode

Unattended mode decides what happens when the session pauses and nobody answers.
It is a SEPARATE switch from `auto`, and it is OFF by default.

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/checkpoint-paths.py --unattended on
```

The threshold offer names this switch as its second option, beside the plain
checkpoint, so you can choose it from the list.

Above the soft threshold, the Stop hook then waits instead of asking. Type
anything inside the wait, and the turn goes back to you within one poll. Stay
silent for the whole wait, and the hook tells the assistant to carry on.

Use it for work that runs past the time you are at the keyboard: overnight, or
across a weekend. It also turns `auto` on. Be exact about what that buys: the
Stop hook in this mode writes no checkpoint at all. Auto is what makes the
SessionStart hook tell the session to carry on after a compaction. The handoff itself is written by the PostCompact hook at each
compaction, whatever either switch says. Turn unattended off, and `auto` goes
back too, unless you chose `auto on` yourself.

Nothing here triggers a compaction, and no hook can. The mode removes the reason
a session halts, and Claude Code's own auto-compact then fires mid-work and
carries on. That is why the mode is not named after compaction.

Two bounds stop a run that goes nowhere. Each one catches a different failure.

- The no-progress fuse compares a fingerprint of the committed head and of the
  size and modification time of every file this session wrote. It reads only this
  session's own files, so a sibling session or a daemon writing to the tree
  cannot reset it. The third evaluation that moves neither stops the mode, so two
  continuations happen before it fires, not three.
- The ceiling stops the mode after 100 continuations in one window.

**A stopped run is silent by design.** The hook records which of the two fuses
stopped it, and the time it stopped, in the session state. It also sends one Telegram notice when you configured a target. Read
that state with `--unattended status`.

The mode stays quiet whenever something else already drives the Stop event.
Three signals claim it. A scheduled `/loop` wakeup claims it. In-flight
background work claims it. A ralph-loop that names this session claims it.

`/goal` is the one case the mode cannot see. The harness holds that state in
memory, so no hook reaches it. Claude Code limits the cost itself. After the
goal's own hook blocks once, `stop_hook_active` suppresses this hook for the
rest of the turn.

Environment defaults, for the whole workspace rather than one session:

```json
"env": {
  "CLAUDE_HANDOFF_UNATTENDED": "1",
  "CLAUDE_HANDOFF_UNATTENDED_WAIT": "60",
  "CLAUDE_HANDOFF_UNATTENDED_POLL": "2",
  "CLAUDE_HANDOFF_UNATTENDED_STALL": "3",
  "CLAUDE_HANDOFF_UNATTENDED_MAX": "100"
}
```

**The wait is clamped at 75 seconds, whatever you set.** Claude Code discards the
output of a hook that times out, so a wait at or above the registered timeout
loses the continuation in silence. The shipped registration allows 90 seconds,
and the clamp leaves room for the work that follows the wait. Raise the
registration first if you need a longer grace period.

## NEVER

- Never invoke `/compact` automatically as part of this skill
- Never clear context as part of this skill
- Never proceed with the next task unless the user explicitly says so after seeing the checkpoint report
- Never skip the pointer file updates - without them, the inject hook has nothing to surface
- Never write into another session's pointer directory
- Never write anything into a pointer directory OTHER than `summary.md` and `prompt.md`
