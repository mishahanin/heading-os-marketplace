Set the compaction threshold for THIS session. Do nothing else.

The argument is `$ARGUMENTS`. Read the first token only.

1. If the token is a whole number, `status`, or `off`, run that command:

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/checkpoint-paths.py --compact-at <token>
```

2. If the argument is empty, run the status command:

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/checkpoint-paths.py --compact-at status
```

3. If the token is anything else, print one line: `usage: /compact-at N|status|off`. Run no command.

Report the command output in one line. Then stop.

The command refuses a number outside 15-90, and refuses one at or below the
session's last rendered fill.

An accepted number also turns `unattended` on, which turns `auto` on with it, so
one command is enough and the hook compacts at the threshold instead of asking.
A refusal raises nothing, and `status` and `off` raise nothing. When the mode is
already on the command leaves the running stretch alone. Only the operator lowers
it, with `/unattended off`.

Do NOT write a checkpoint file. Do NOT run `/compact`. Do NOT continue any task.
